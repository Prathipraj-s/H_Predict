# Heart Failure Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
* This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict heart failure based on certain medical parameters. The dataset used here contains various features such as age, sex, blood pressure, serum creatinine levels, etc. The ANN model is trained on this dataset to classify whether a patient is likely to experience heart failure.
  # Requirements:
# Make sure you have the following libraries installed in your Python environment:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow
* Keras
  # You can install these libraries via pip:
  **pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras**
  # Steps to Run:
  # Download the Dataset:
  * Obtain the heart failure dataset (e.g., heart_failure_dataset.csv) from a reliable source or repository.

# Clone the Repository: 
* Clone the repository containing the Jupyter Notebook (Heart_Failure_Prediction_ANN.ipynb) and the dataset
**git clone https://github.com/Prathipraj-s/H_Predict.git**
# Open Notebook: 
*In your web browser, navigate to Heart_Failure_Prediction_ANN.ipynb and open it.

# run the Code Cells: 
*Execute each code cell in the notebook sequentially. Make sure to read any instructions provided within the notebook cells.

# Interpret Results: 
*Once all cells have been executed, you'll see the results of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Interpret the results to understand the performance of the model.
